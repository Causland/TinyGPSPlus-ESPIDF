# TinyGPSPlus for ESP-IDF

A compatability layer to use the popular TinyGPSPlus library on the ESP32 with ESP-IDF. This is not needed if you are using the Arduino framework on the ESP32.

The TinyGPSPlus library is a high-performance, easy-to-use NMEA parser, often used for GPS message parsing.

For documentation on the TinyGPSPlus library, see the [TinyGPSPlus page on Arduiniana](http://arduiniana.org/libraries/tinygpsplus/) or [the TinyGPSPlus examples](https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus/tree/master/examples).
